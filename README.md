Excel dashboard for sales and profit analysis

# Project Overview

This dashboard was built using Microsoft Excel and a structured sales database. The objective was to reduce reporting time by 60% and empower managers to make faster data-driven decisions.

It visualizes sales and profit trends across time, states, product categories, and customers.

# Business Context

The company aims to optimize its commercial operations using historical data. This study focuses on:

1.  Measuring annual profit performance  
2.  Mapping sales and profitability by U.S. state  
3.  Detecting over- and under-performing product categories  
4.  Recommending improvements for marketing, supply chain, and logistics  

# Dashboard Features

- Total Sales and Profit Overview  
- Profit by Year and Category (Furniture, Office Supplies, Technology)  
- Sales by Product Category  
- Top 5 Customers by Profit  
- Sales by Month  
- Sales by State (U.S. Map)  
- Customer Count by Year  

-> Built entirely in Excel using Pivot Tables, Slicers, and Charts.

# Key Insights

- High concentration of revenue in a few products and regions.  
- Technology is the most profitable category.  
- Year-over-year growth in customer base and revenue.  
- Some states show high sales but low profit margins.  

# Recommendations

1. Increase stock for Top 10 products to ensure 24h delivery.  
2. Optimize surplus inventory — reduce slow-movers by 5–10% and monitor performance.  
3. Review state-level pricing/logistics where high sales ≠ high margin.  
4. Run targeted marketing in high-potential, underutilized regions.
